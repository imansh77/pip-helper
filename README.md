# pip-helper
**Identify libraries which you installed with omitting those you didn't use in order to have a nice and neat requirements file**

First of all remember it only works with projects which are in one directory (in order to correctly check distinct between modules and libraries, maybe in future updates it gets better) 

So how to use it :
1. Fork the project 
2. cd to your pip-helper project where main.py exists 
3. In terminal type : \
`python main.py` + your project path which has python files \
for example: \
`python main.py /Imansh/Github/pip-helper`

The result will be in a `requirements.txt` in the pip-helper path.
